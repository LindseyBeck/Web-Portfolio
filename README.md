# Web-Portfolio
Website Portfolio
This website portfolio is to showcase some of my digital media projects, writing, and photography.
My web portfolio is intended to be mainly a website to showcase a few different creative avenues I might want to pursue as a career. These may include photography, video editing, or graphic design. The purpose I want my portfolio to serve is to give people a way to see my personality and my talents in one clear and easy layout. My primary audience is future or potential employers or anyone interested in knowing more about my work. Mainly people around my own age and network as well as potential jobs. I imagine they will encounter the site just from me talking about it. I want to convey my professional but also creative and fun personality through my site. Design choices I include to convey this will be aesthetic and cohesive color schemes throughout the website with an engaging but simple layout. I think it is important to keep in mind that anything I put on the site will be seen by anyone, so I need to make sure what I put out is acceptable and up to my own standards. Although I am not certain what kind of job I am looking for just yet, I feel like having a wide range (but not too wide) of skills to show allow me more flexibility with this.
